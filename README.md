  - This is my first Unreal Engine 5 project. This project is a reference from the Star Wars movie franchise.
  - This project is done in Unreal Engine 5.3.2.
  - I was able to do this project and learn UE5 because of the [Bad Decision YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9qixi858Ag&list=PLIn-yd4vnXbjWeYqU7epakdnVzoysMToy). I highly recommend checking out the channel if you want to learn UE5.
  - I was using an RTX 4060 8GB graphic card and had no issues working with UE5.
